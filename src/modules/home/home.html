      <p>Assignment</p>

      <p>Your assignment is to implement a simple Aurelia Application satisfying the requirements listed below.</p>

      <p>Start by forking the repository.</p>

      <p>Requirements</p>

      <p>The app should be able to list all movies from the api: https://swapi.dev/documentation</p>

      <p>Styling is not required.</p>

      <p>Additional Questions</p>

      <p>Fetching data from a third party api can be slow, how would you improve performance in this application?</p>

      <p>Testing can be benificial, what is reasonable to test in this application?</p>

      <p>Currently the project only support css, how would you add support for less or sass?</p>
